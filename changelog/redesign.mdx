## We just Rekt everything

import Sparkles from '~/components/sparkles';

This week, I established our first <Sparkles>magical moment</Sparkles>:

Simply open our site to see **the top articles** shared by **the top experts** in a given field—with live updates from Twitter.

To do this, I first investigated the differences between our "algorithm" (i.e. [this massive PostgreSQL query](https://github.com/rooteco/tweetscape/blob/develop/app/query.server.ts#L454-L495) that I shared earlier in [**#tweetscape**](https://discord.gg/3KYQBJwRSS)) for ranking top articles and the one used by [Rekt](https://feed.rekt.news) (which is a reliable OG for crypto news from Twitter).
Turns out, the only major difference in our approaches were:

1. Rekt has their own proprietary influencer ranking algorithm (similar to [the Borg Collective](https://borgcollective.notion.site/About-15b9db2c1f414cf998c5abc58b715176)'s [algorithm for trust](https://borgcollective.notion.site/About-the-Algorithm-5434e4695d60456cb481acb98bb88b18) but more effective for the Crypto niche Rekt resides in) and, more importantly;
2. Rekt includes quoting tweets (tweets that quote tweets with article links) in their article aggregations.

Thus, I integrated those adjustments into our existing queries so **you can now view Rekt-quality rankings for any Twitter list or Hive cluster**.
And the Borg Collective just released some [pretty cool new clusters](https://twitter.com/niicholaschiang/status/1510038559046078464): you can now explore top articles for [climate change](/clusters/climate/articles) and (as soon as Hive indexes them) [cannabis](/clusters/cannabis/articles) or even [yoga](/clusters/yoga/articles).

## Clutter free redesign

I've redesigned TS to feel more app-like and am using `react-spring` to add fluidity to every user interaction.

Some of the feedback **@Shingai** shared earlier emphasized how Tweetscape's columns felt overwhelming: there was just so much content on the screen at once to be explored.
Recently, I've also been feeling pretty overwhelmed as I start to use Twitter more; there's just so much good information being shared and so much going on that it's hard to figure out what to focus on.
Tools like TweetDeck, although useful, can sometimes even amplify this overwhelming feeling (e.g. by showing you way too much all at once).

I'm thinking that Tweetscape can work to reduce that clutter (and that "a little bit of everything" feeling that pervades Twitter) by having a minimalist design similar to Notion—the interface disappears when you don't need it—so you can focus on your reading—and appears just as you reach for it.

It's still very much a work-in-progress, but I think this initial redesign gets us a tad bit closer to the point where opening Tweetscape becomes a relaxing experience where you're able to be intentional about what you learn about (and go deep into a few topics everyday instead of simply skimming over the shallow surface-level "what's happening" that Twitter's existing feed design encourages).

See [#72](https://github.com/rooteco/tweetscape/pulls/72) for technical details.

## [Teaser] Explore anyone's feed

Because of the way TS (Tweetscape) is architected (and, for that matter, Twitter itself), it's a trivial task for me to let you view another person's Twitter feed.
You'll be able to explore what **@elonmusk** or **@POTUS** sees in their feeds.

Eventually, you'll be able to compare, side-by-side, what **@POTUS** v.s. **@RealDonaldTrump** see in their feeds and get a better understanding of how someone else may see the web and therefore the world.

This is just a small example of the experiments that can be run on an open Postgres-based Twitter.
We can't wait to see what you'll build once given the tools (e.g. an unencumbered PostgreSQL clone of Twitter) that we now have.

## Fixes & Improvements

- You can now use [Rekt scores](https://feed.rekt.news/parlor) to rank and explore [the top crypto articles](/rekt/crypto/articles) from Twitter (introduced by [#71](https://github.com/rooteco/tweetscape/pulls/71)).
- SWR database queries are now performed concurrently;
  I abuse `Promise.all` everywhere possible to reduce initial `loader` execution times and thus reduce perceived load times.
- Links now prefetch page content (HTML + CSS + JS) and `loader` data on hover to reduce load times.
- Fixed an issue where likes and retweets would disappear after being acknowledged server-side.
  Now, I invalidate SWR caches on a per-user basis after each like or retweet action (which invalidates stale like and retweet data).
- Fixed an issue where clusters would not load for anonymous users.
- Fixed an issue where tweet replies would not load for anonymous users.
- Decreased the intensity of the on-hover tweet color change to be more consistent with Twitter's design language.
- TS now hides retweets by default when viewing top articles for a cluster or list.
- Moved identifiers from `text` columns to `int8` (i.e. `bigint`) columns to increase DBMS performance.
- Memoized render-intensive components (like the `<Article>`) with `dequal/lite` to improve performance.
- Addressed the URL search parameter conflicts between, for example, the articles list sort (now `?as=`) and the article's tweets list sort (now `?ats=`).
  Each filter and sort now has a unique field in a shared `Param` enum.
- Removed the unnecessary external links from the `<Article>` list item component.
- Moved our changelog from using `marked` with generic `.md` assets to using **@KentCDodds**'s `mdx-bundler` with dynamic `.mdx` files.
  This enabled the unnecessarily fancy <Sparkles>sparkles</Sparkles> animation you witnessed earlier—and here. 🙃
